In this project, we have designed an “ML-Driven Wirelessly Controlled Robot” that uses machine learning to detect objects of a given class and automatically navigate towards the nearest object of that class found within its camera view. The robot does not use any external sensors, detectors, or modules to perform this task, and is able to detect over 80 different classes of objects. The robot can be controlled via three modes: Physical Joystick, ML Object Detection, and Web‑Based Virtual Joystick. The goal of this project is to serve as a starting point for designing a robot which may be used to find or travel to objects on campus, potentially for use in transporting items to specific locations, or automatically tracking lost items without human effort.
